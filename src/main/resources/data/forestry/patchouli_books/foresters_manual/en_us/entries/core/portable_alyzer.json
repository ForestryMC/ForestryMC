Luckily there is the Portable Analyzer to help. It provides a non-invasive way to glean every last bit of information from your specimens, butterflies and trees. Just provide a honey or honeydew drop to pacify the specimen to have everything you ever wanted to know but were afraid to ask at your fingertips."
