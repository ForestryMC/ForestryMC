However, biogas engines have one additional quirk: They cannot explode from overheating, but they need a minimum operating temperature. You can fill a biogas engine up to the brim with delicious fuel and it will still refuse to start up. The reason is quite simply that it needs to reach a certain temperature before it can begin to burn fuel."

The engine will then start to heat up and once it has reached minimum operating temperature it will start to produce energy. Producing energy generates itself heat, so after the initial warmup a running biogas engine will keep itself heated without using up any further lava from"

Also, if the activating redstone signal is interrupted, the burning of fuel will pause completely: fuel will not be lost, but if the Engine stays off for too long, it will need to consume some Lava to heat up again once the redstone signal is re-applied.$(br2)However, there is one important exception: If you use just plain water or milk to power your engine, the engine will not generate enough heat to counter the natural heat dissipation."

A water or milk fueled engine will invariably use up all the lava in the secondary tank and stop producing energy. However, you can pipe in lava using BuildCraft pipes if you choose to do so."
