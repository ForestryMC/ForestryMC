      "text": "The bee house was one of my earliest discoveries. The discovery of this small bee housing was more like a coincidence. I forgot a honey comb in a small wooden box that I had crafted out of some wooden planks and wooden slabs. After a while, the box was full with bees; they had started to build their home in this box. I crafted a similar box like I had crafted before, placed a comb in it, and named it \"Bee House\"."
