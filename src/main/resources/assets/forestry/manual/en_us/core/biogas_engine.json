However, biogas engines have one additional quirk: They cannot explode from overheating, but they need a minimum operating temperature. You can fill a biogas engine up to the brim with delicious fuel and it will still refuse to start up. The reason is quite simply that it needs to reach a certain temperature before it can begin to burn fuel."
