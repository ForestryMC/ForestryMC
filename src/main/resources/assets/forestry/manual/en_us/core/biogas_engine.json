However, biogas engines have one additional quirk: They cannot explode from overheating, but they need a minimum operating temperature. You can fill a biogas engine up to the brim with delicious fuel and it will still refuse to start up. The reason is quite simply that it needs to reach a certain temperature before it can begin to burn fuel."

The engine will then start to heat up and once it has reached minimum operating temperature it will start to produce energy. Producing energy generates itself heat, so after the initial warmup a"
