### Notes

This is only the API. It is not intended to be used by itself, but rather for use either with Forestry itself or another mod which wants to use a functionality of Forestry.

Package versioning follows the rules laid out by http://semver.org/

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes game mechanics, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new game mechanic and then having the PR rejected because it doesnâ€™t fit gameplay-wise.
