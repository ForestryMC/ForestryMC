/**
 * Forestry's API is divided into several subcategories to make it easier to understand.
 * <p>
 * If you need to distribute API files, try to only include the parts you are actually
 * using to minimize conflicts due to API changes.
 * <p>
 * .core     - Miscallenous base classes and interfaces as well as some basics for tools, armor, game modes and stuff needed by biome mods.
 * .fuels    - Managers and classes to facilitate adding fuels to various engines and machines.
 * .recipes  - Managers and helpers to facilitate adding new recipes to various machines.
 * .storage  - Managers, events and interfaces for defining new backpacks and handling backpack behaviour.
 * .mail     - Anything related to handling letters and adding new mail carrier systems.
 * .genetics - Shared code for all genetic subclasses.
 * \ .apiculture       - Bees.
 * \ .arboriculture    - Trees.
 * \ .lepidopterology  - Butterflies.
 * <p>
 * Note that if Forestry is not present, all these references will be null.
