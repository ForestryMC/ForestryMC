====================================

### What is it?

Forestry is a Minecraft mod that expands on the game's agricultural aspects by adding new items, machines, and ores. The mod is designed to be compatible with IndustrialCraft2 and BuildCraft 3 and utilizes Redstone Flux. The core features of the mod include beekeeping, tree breeding, and automated farming. In addition, the mod adds "green" fuel and engines, honey-based foods, and backpacks for increased inventory space. Players can extract new ores and materials from the world to get started with the mod and can eventually build multi-block farms for efficient crop harvesting.
